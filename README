Qhub

Goal

A distributed hub for the ADC-protocol, which
aims to scale well above all. Only moderately
performance-tweaked code, simplicity will be
regarded as more important than efficiency, 
unless it conflicts with the goal of
maximizing the total amount of users in the
logical hub. The physical hubs arent
considered as important from a performance
viewpoint. 


Not made with multiple protocols in mind, 
although its a possible future area of
enhancement. 

As a secondary goal will be producing a
simple and accurate model for the
relationship between bandwidth per hub,
number of physical hubs and users.
