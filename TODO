Start doing things on the TODO

remove Liboop+ADNS, replace with selectable DNS thread(s)+poll/libevent(win32?) mechanism. 
(I see no reason for Liboop since libevent does all and is more portable?)
Maybe also a pure win32-solution that is not libevent.
	Start this by removing all ADNS/Liboop traces from interfaces.

Fix autoconf-macros: remove unused, and start using more of the existing ones.

Low-level network handling
	Queue broadcast messages
	Rate-limiting (allow bursting or not? its DDOSable.)
	Add customizable flood protection in ADC or ADCSocket

Protocol stuff
	Send delta-INFs
	Check CID at logon (we never ADC::ESC it anywhere.. that might cause trouble)
	LO1 handling (Status of this in spec?)

Begin work on multihub support

Polish plugins 
	what about controlling chains of plugins? Can plugins stop following plugins
		from executing?
	Are plugins able to filter/suppress output from the non-plugin hubcore?
	What about filtering stuff on many outgoing clients? (think a modified list of users: the
		plugin-instance for one user wants no other users to receive his INFs, this can mean work
		if there are only hooks for incoming data?)) 
	Make a clean interface for event-notification (de)registration. Make this interface
		independent on the actual underlying method used. Try to find some kind of smallest common
		properties of different methods.
