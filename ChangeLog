- 0.9 -
* Pseudo is now in charge :)
* upgraded to ADC 0.9
* switched interhub code to use ADC
* interhubs are now stored in a much more useful way
* moved plugins to separate directory
* started use of exceptions (error.h)
* log(<qerr|qstat>,<msg>) in "error.h" can be used to log messages (fprintf 
use almost totally removed) (yes,, I know we have std::log in <cmath>, but
overloads should take care of that
* added command line arguments. Use qhub --help to view
* rewrote ADCSocket parsing code -- now much, much simpler (might fail on big
reads, though... haven't tested)
* plugins currently don't work and cause a segfault :)
* CIDs are checked for validity on login (ie, that they represent a 64-bit
value... untested, but shouldn't break anything)
