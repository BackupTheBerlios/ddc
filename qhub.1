.TH QHUB 1 2006-01-23 DDC Qhub Distributed ADC Hub Documentation
.SH NAME
qhub \- distributed ADC hub that aims to scale well above all
.SH SYNOPSIS
qhub [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Qhub is hub software for the up-and-coming ADC protocol with the unique characteristic that it is decentralized.  Much of the default output is solely for debugging purposes.  The network layout used is the same as that of irc: a branching tree with no cycles.
.SH OPTIONS
The best way to know the current options is to run `qhub --help' -- this manpage will probably become outdated very quickly.
.SH SETTINGS
Qhub stores all of its settings in qhub.xml, located in whatever configuration dir was set at compile time (/usr/local/etc by default).  All settings are encased within the <qhub> tag, and each component has its own subsection.  All elements needed for basic connectivity are in section <__core>; as with C identifiers, tags beginning with two underscores are reserved.
