Start doing things on the TODO

Fix autoconf-macros: remove unused, and start using more of the existing ones.

Low-level network handling
	Queue broadcast messages
	Rate-limiting (allow bursting or not? its DDOSable.)
	Add customizable flood protection in ADCSocket

add signal handlers for libevent so we can be usable by start-stop-daemon and other things
		(like SIGHUP to reload config)

Protocol stuff
	Dont allow nick-collisions (made much more difficult by utf-8)
	Send delta-INFs

More work on multihub support (much has been accomplished however)
	automatically try reconnecting every few minutes if an interhub connection fails

re-work UserData class, possibly using just a hash_map<string,boost::any>
	boost::any_cast causes problems with plugins; the underlying dynamic_cast requires RTTI,
		not present if plugin not yet loaded

Polish plugins
	add operator functions plugin for bans, etc
	what about controlling chains of plugins? Can plugins stop following plugins
		from executing?
	Are plugins able to filter/suppress output from the non-plugin hubcore?
	What about filtering stuff on many outgoing clients? (think a modified list of users: the
		plugin-instance for one user wants no other users to receive his INFs, this can mean work
		if there are only hooks for incoming data?)) 
	Make a clean interface for event-notification (de)registration.
		(IO-refactor branch solves this)
